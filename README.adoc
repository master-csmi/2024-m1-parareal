# Lorenz System with Parareal Algorithm

This repository contains code for simulating the Lorenz system using the Parareal algorithm for parallel time integration.
The Lorenz system is a set of ordinary differential equations that models a dynamic system exhibiting chaotic behavior. 
It was proposed by meteorologist Edward Lorenz in 1963 and has since been widely used to study phenomena such as convection and turbulence.
