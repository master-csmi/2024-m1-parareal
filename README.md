# Parareal Algorithm

## Project Description
This project focuses on the development and implementation of the parareal algorithm in both sequential and parallel formats. The algorithm will be applied to the Lorenz Model of order 1 and 4, using both constant and adaptive time stepping.

## Roadmap
1. Implement Lorenz Model for order 1 and 4 using constant time stepping.
2. Implement Lorenz order 4 solver with adaptive time stepping.
3. Add support for Lorenz results visualisation.
4. Study scipy.ode with constant and adaptive time stepping.
5. Study the parareal algorithm.
6. Implement the initial version of parareal in sequential.
7. Compare different ode solvers and parareal on the Lorenz system.
8. Study a parallel version of the parareal algorithm.
9. Implement the parallel version of the parareal algorithm.
